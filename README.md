Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   The initial focus for this project was for Arged banking. we were asked to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead   Banking provided a list of functional requirements and described what they needed in their application.

What did you do particularly well?
I though my code was organized well and this was prolly the project I felt most confident about.  I thought the code was well written.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code would be more efficient if it would work.  I was never able to get the code to run in my visual studios. I was unsure if it was a code issue or a program issue.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the code for the display screen was the most difficult.  I looked at several examples of other displays trying to figure out how to write the code.  I found that this site, git hub was very helpful.  I was able to read some explanations on how to format the code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think all of the skills from this project are transferable.  Every project or code you write helps familiarize and provide you with experience.  The only way to get better is to write code and practice.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to keep the comments very simple and easy to read.
